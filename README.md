##  Project Structure
- notebooks → Jupyter Notebook with full analysis.
- reports/figures/ Saved figures (PNG format).
- data/ → Raw and processed CSV files (not uploaded here due to size).
- `README.md → Project description.



##  Key Findings
- **Dog adoptions rose during the pandemic** but levelled off by 2023.  
- **Owner surrenders increased sharply from 2020–2022**, linked to cost-of-living pressures.  
- **UK dog population peaked in 2022–23**, then stabilised.  
- **Council spending on stray dogs fell**, while strays collected also decreased.
